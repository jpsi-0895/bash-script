The duty of a System Administrator is really tough as they have to monitor the `servers`, `users`, `logs`, `create backups`, and so on. For the most `repetitive tasks`, many administrators write scripts to automate their day-to-day work.

Here, we have written a shell script that aims to help newbies by providing information about their `system`, `network`, `users`, `load`, `log`, `log rotation`, `RAM`, `host`, `internal IP`, `external IP`, `uptime`, etc. While it may not automate all tasks of a typical system admin, it can be helpful in certain situations.

We have taken care of formatting the output to a certain extent. The script doesnâ€™t contain any malicious content and it can be run using a normal user account. 

In fact, it is recommended to run this script as a `user` and not as `root`.
